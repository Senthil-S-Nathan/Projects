Title: Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Introduction:

In todayâ€™s fast-paced financial markets, having access to accurate and timely stock market predictions is crucial for investors and traders. The ability to forecast stock prices can help individuals make informed decisions and optimize their investment strategies. In this project, we have developed a web application using Python and Flask framework that enables users to visualize historical stock data, predict future stock prices, and make data-driven investment decisions.

Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to create a user-friendly platform that leverages machine learning algorithms to forecast stock prices. By integrating various Python libraries such as yfinance for fetching historical stock data, Prophet for time series forecasting, and Plotly for interactive data visualization, the application provides valuable insights into the stock market trends.

Key Features:

1.User Authentication: The web application includes a user authentication system that allows users to sign up, log in, and log out securely. Passwords are hashed using the `generate_password_hash` function from the Werkzeug library to enhance security.

2.Data Visualization: Users can visualize historical stock data using interactive charts generated with Plotly and Matplotlib libraries. The application provides options to plot open and close prices of selected stocks over a specified time period, facilitating comprehensive analysis of stock trends.

3.Stock Price Prediction: The core functionality of the application is stock price prediction. Users can input the name or symbol of the company, select the desired forecast period, and the system utilizes the Prophet library to generate future stock price predictions. The forecasts are presented graphically, allowing users to evaluate potential investment opportunities.

4.Data Validation: The application incorporates robust data validation mechanisms to ensure the integrity and reliability of user inputs. It checks for duplicate accounts during registration, validates email addresses, and ensures that passwords match.

5.Error Handling: Error handling is implemented throughout the application to provide informative feedback to users. Whether it's an invalid email address, incorrect login credentials, or missing stock symbols, users are notified promptly with appropriate error messages.

Technical Implementation:

Flask Framework: Flask is used as the primary web framework for developing the application. It provides routing, request handling, and session management capabilities required for building web applications.

MySQL Database: MySQL is utilized to store user account information securely. The Flask-MySQLdb extension is employed to establish a connection with the MySQL database and execute SQL queries.

Machine Learning with Prophet: Prophet, a time series forecasting library developed by Facebook, is integrated into the application for predicting future stock prices. The library utilizes an additive regression model to analyze historical data and generate forecasts with uncertainty intervals.

Interactive Visualization with Plotly: Plotly is employed for creating interactive and visually appealing charts that enhance the user experience. Plotly's integration with Flask enables seamless rendering of dynamic plots within web pages.

Conclusion:
The Stock Price Prediction Web Application developed using Python and Flask provides users with a comprehensive platform for analyzing historical stock data and making informed investment decisions. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and interactive visualization techniques, the application empowers users to explore stock market trends, predict future price movements, and optimize their investment strategies. With its user-friendly interface and robust functionality, the application serves as a valuable tool for both novice and experienced investors navigating the complexities of the financial markets.
