Objective:

The objective of your project is to automatically generate a concise summary of a PDF document on disaster management.
By summarizing the document, you aim to provide users with a quick overview of its key points and insights without needing to read the entire text.
Text Preprocessing:

Tokenization:

The text extracted from the PDF document is broken down into individual sentences using NLTK's sent_tokenize function. Each sentence is further tokenized into words using NLTK's word_tokenize.
Punctuation Removal: Punctuation marks are removed from the words to ensure that they are clean and ready for analysis.
Stopword Removal: Common stopwords such as "the", "is", "and" are removed from the text. These words do not usually carry much meaning and can be safely excluded from the summary.
Stemming: Words are reduced to their root form using the Porter Stemmer algorithm. This process helps in reducing inflected words to their base or root form, thus improving the efficiency of subsequent analysis.
Sentence Similarity Calculation:

Jaccard Similarity:

The Jaccard similarity coefficient is used to measure the similarity between two sets of words (sentences in this case). It is calculated as the intersection of the sets divided by the union of the sets.
Cosine Similarity: Although not explicitly mentioned, cosine similarity is commonly used in TextRank-based algorithms. It measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors and is often used to compare the similarity of documents or sentences represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space.
TextRank Algorithm:

Importance Score Calculation:

TextRank algorithm assigns importance scores to each sentence based on its similarity with other sentences in the document.
Sentence Graph Construction: The sentences are represented as nodes in a graph, and the similarity between sentences determines the edges between them.
Iterative Algorithm: The TextRank algorithm iteratively updates the importance scores of sentences based on the scores of their neighboring sentences. This process continues until convergence is reached.
PDF Text Extraction:

PyPDF2 Library:

PyPDF2 is used to extract text from the PDF document. It iterates through each page of the PDF, extracts the text, and concatenates it into a single string.
Summary Generation:

Top Sentences Selection:

Once the importance scores of sentences are calculated, the top-ranked sentences are selected to form the summary.
Number of Sentences: The number of sentences to include in the summary is specified by the user as num_sentences.
Concatenation: Finally, the selected sentences are concatenated to form the summary text.


Technologies used:

Python:

The entire project is implemented in Python, a versatile and widely used programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
Natural Language Processing (NLP):

Natural Language Processing techniques are employed to analyze and understand the content of the PDF document. This includes tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and similarity calculation.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): NLTK is a popular Python library for NLP tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and calculating word frequencies. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for text analysis and manipulation.
TextRank Algorithm:

The TextRank algorithm is used to identify the most important sentences in the document. It is a graph-based algorithm inspired by Google's PageRank algorithm and is commonly used for extractive text summarization.
PyPDF2:

PyPDF2 is a Python library for reading and manipulating PDF files. It is used to extract text from the PDF document pages.
Other Python Libraries:

Other standard Python libraries such as io, operator, and PyPDF2 are used for various tasks such as file handling, sorting, and PDF text extraction.
